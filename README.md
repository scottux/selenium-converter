# Selenium Batch Converter

Quick Use:
```
node index.js "input/directory" "output/directory"
```

## What it does

This tool is responsible for doing batch conversions of Selenium IDE
recorded tests.

### Formatters

Currently there is only a C#/Webdriver formatter, but it should be easy to 
port other formats from Selenium IDE.
